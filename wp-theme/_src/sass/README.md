# Forty Sass Framework Template

Simply put, there's no fancy magic behind the Forty Sass Framework Template. We've certainly worked with existing popular frameworks in the past. But they felt cumbersome, bloated, and produced a lot of overhead. More importantly, you're locked into their pattern and thought process.

Our template exists to give you a light and base level toolkit to build off of. We're not here to tell you how to write or handle your project. After all, no two are the same.

That being said, we do favor [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) principles and methodology for re-usable and felxible modules, which are independent from individual page context.

If you want to take the [BEM](http://bem.info/method/), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), or [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) approach, the choice is yours. Do what works and feels best for you and your team.

##**Requirements**

* [Sass Globbing](https://rubygems.org/gems/sass-globbing) - While you don't have to use it, you can individually call sass files.
* If you are using Grunt, look for [require](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass#require) under Grunt Contrib Sass, and makes sure to add in the options.
* If you are getting errors with Sass Globbing, remove current version of Sass Globbing and install [an updated release](http://rubygems.org/gems/sass-globbing-pr-20) which fixes realtive paths for Grunt
* Ruby Sass is best at the moment since lib Sass is still lacking some @extend support.

##**Recommended Usage**

####base/

In [base/](https://github.com/40Digits/forty-sass/tree/master/base) you'll find all your base styles: resets, typography, print, forms, etc.

####helpers/

The [helpers/](https://github.com/40Digits/forty-sass/tree/master/helpers) folder generally contains tools which help with formatting of your application. They either give you ways to sync with javascript, give you mixins, or utilities to [speed up dev process](https://github.com/40Digits/forty-sass/blob/master/helpers/_utilities.scss). In most cases you won't be making many edits here, unless you are adding mixins and functions that are project specific. In that case, you would be making modifications and adding mixins to [/helpers/mixins/](https://github.com/40Digits/forty-sass/blob/master/helpers/mixins/). Please keep each mixin in its own file or group them accordingly.

| File            | Usage                                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| fonts           | When using third-party fonts, it's recommended that you utilize the font mixin. For services such as typekit, you do not need to add in a @font-face. Where as for services such as fonts.com, which have an odd font-weight association, it's recommended you utilize an @font-face for best results. See file for usage examples. |
| js-breakpoints  | Syncs up our CSS Media Queries to work with [MQ Sync](https://github.com/40Digits/jquery-mq-sync) |
| media-queries   | Should not be edited as it contains the mixin necessary to make all of the media queries work. |
| extends         | Any and all %placeholders and %extends specific to your application should go in here. |
| utilities       | Default helper functions to speed up your dev process. |
| /mixins/        | You should place all of your project specific mixins in here. |

######utilities.scss

| Sample Usage & Comments                                          |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@include font-smoothing;`   The body class comes with font-smoothing already applied. However, font-smoothing does not carry over to input fields and buttons. |
| `@include abs-center;`   Absolute center an element, this only works if there is a width and height on element. For other ways to center, read [Centering in CSS: A Complete Guide](http://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) |
| `@extend %visually-hidden;`   Hide an element from the screen, but still keep it for screen readers. Very handy and recommended instead of utilizing text-indent method. |
| `@include rgba(#000, .3);`   Gives you a cross browser alpha channel background color. Mostly used for IE8. |
| `@include opacity(.4);`   Gives you a cross browser opacity that works in IE8 |
| `@extend %bg-cover;`   Gives you background-size:cover support in IE8 |
| `@extend %naked-list;`   Sometimes you need a list without any formatting. Instead of resetting it on the base level, this is a much cleaner and safer approach to use when needed. |
| `@extend %naked-button;`   As with the list, this resets the `<button>` styles to bare bones. It's extremely handy for mobile devices as they tend to apply native UI styles. Looking at you iOS!|

####layout/

The [layout/](https://github.com/40Digits/forty-sass/tree/master/layout) folder contains styles which are specific to the layout or skeleton structure of your application. In this case think footer, header, navigations, sidebars, and main content area.

####modules/

If you're not familiar with [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), please take some time to review. With SMACSS, we aim to identify repeating visual patterns. Some of those patterns could be: paginations, tabs, banners, hero areas, or even wysiwyg styles. By coding for visual patterns, we drive away from a single page mentality.  Every module should aim to be completely independent of its context and should work within any layout container.

####app/

The [app/](https://github.com/40Digits/forty-sass/tree/master/app) folder contains all of your application styles. These styles vary anywhere from templates to pages. In order to keep consistency going, especially in Wordpress projects, please use the following prefix method:

| Prefix        | Usage                                                  |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| page-         | pages                                                  |
| temp-         | template specific files                                |
| cpt-          | anything that is a custom post type                    |

####variables/

The [variables/](https://github.com/40Digits/forty-sass/tree/master/variables) folder contains all your settings throughout the site. The most important file to take a look around would be the [settings.scs](https://github.com/40Digits/forty-sass/blob/master/variables/_settings.scss) and make any adjustment necessary for your application.

The settings.scss file also houses your media query settings. In here you will be able to define additional media queries which should be necessary for your project. You are welcome to make adjustment to the breakpoints already defined, but we highly recommend against editing the small, medium, and large breakpoints.

Our breakpoints are defined in a way that don't depend on devices specificity. Instead we see them scaling depending on the medium. This gives us room to define breakpoints that fit our application.

Please note that we utilize mobile-first in all of our development.

```css
// Media query - min-width
$mq-min-mini:       em(480);
$mq-min-small:      em(600);
$mq-min-medium:     em(768);
$mq-min-large:      em(960);
$mq-min-xlarge:     em(1220);
$mq-min-xxlarge:    em(1440);

// Media query - max-width
$mq-max-tiny:       $mq-min-mini - em(1);
$mq-max-mini:       $mq-min-small - em(1);
$mq-max-small:      $mq-min-medium - em(1);
$mq-max-medium:     $mq-min-large - em(1);
$mq-max-large:      $mq-min-xlarge - em(1);
$mq-max-xlarge:     $mq-min-xxlarge - em(1);

$mq: (
  'mini'            : ( min-width: $mq-min-mini ),
  'small'           : ( min-width: $mq-min-small ),
  'medium'          : ( min-width: $mq-min-medium ),
  'large'           : ( min-width: $mq-min-large ),
  'xlarge'          : ( min-width: $mq-min-xlarge ),
  'xxlarge'         : ( min-width: $mq-min-xxlarge ),

  'max-tiny'        : ( max-width: $mq-max-tiny ),
  'max-mini'        : ( max-width: $mq-max-mini ),
  'max-small'       : ( max-width: $mq-max-small ),
  'max-medium'      : ( max-width: $mq-max-medium ),
  'max-large'       : ( max-width: $mq-max-large ),
  'max-xlarge'      : ( max-width: $mq-max-xlarge ),

  'print'           : ( print ),
  'tab-port'        : ( screen and (min-device-width: $mq-min-medium) and (max-device-width: $mq-max-medium) and (orientation: portrait) ),
  'tab-land'        : ( screen and (min-device-width: $mq-min-medium) and (max-device-width: $mq-tablet-landscape) and (orientation: landscape) )
);
```

To use a media query:

```css
@include mq(medium) {
  // styles that get added to a medium breakpoint
}
@include mq(large) {
  // styles that get added to a large breakpoint
}
@include mq(max-medium) {
  // styles that get added from large breakpoint down
}

// In this example, we are starting off with a red font color and a font-size of 10px.
// Once we hit the medium breakpoint, the font-size changes to 15px/
// When we view this style in print mode, the color is changed to black, but note that the color is red.
.style {
  color: red;
  font-size: em(10);
  @include mq(medium) {
    font-size: em(15);
  }
  @include mq(print) {
    color: #000;
  }
}
```

To add a new media query breakpoint:

```css
// Inside $mq map, define any additional breakpoints after 'tab-land'.
$mq: (
  ...
  'tab-land'        : ( screen and (min-device-width: $mq-min-medium) and (max-device-width: $mq-tablet-landscape) and (orientation: landscape) ),

  'custom-mq'       : ( (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 600px) )
);
```

####vendor/

All [vendor/](https://github.com/40Digits/forty-sass/tree/master/vendor) specific stylesheets should go into their own folder. The framework comes with a stripped down gravity-forms style guide for usage.


***

##**Styleguide**

####General Rules
* When possible, avoid using ID's, use classes as much as possible.
* Don't over-qualify selectors.
* Don't get crazy with nesting of rules.
* Media queries belong right after pseudo-classes.
  - Min-Width - smallest to largest
  - Max-Width - largest to smallest
* Use auto prefixer, check for settings in the gruntfile.js
* Break into as many small files as it makes sense:
  - Produces easier to maintain styles.
  - Easier to find rules.
* Be generous with comments and as descriptive as possible.

####Properties
* CSS rules should be comma separated and reside on new lines.
* Order of CSS properties:
  - Positioning
  - Display & Box Model
  - Color
  - Text
  - Transform
  - Animations
  - Z-index
* Order of Sass extends and properties:
  - @extend(s)
  - @include(s)
  - "regular" styles
* Nest all pseduo-classes directly beneath base properties and values.
* Use z-index scale found in utilities.scss

####Naming Conventions
* Classes and IDs are lowercase with words separated by a dash.
* Variablize all colors, numbers, etc.
  - $color-blue
  - $color-azure
  - $color-purple
* Images
  - Image file names are lowercase with words separated by a dash.
  - Image file names are prefixed with their usage.
    - icon-home.png
    - bg-home.png
    - hero-about.png
* .js- prefixed class names for elements relying upon javascript
* .is- prefixed class names for stateful classes
  - .is-active
  - .is-enabled

####Style Scoping
All of your styles should be reusing general component level styles defined below. Page level name-spaces however can be helpful for overriding generic components in very specific contexts.

Page level overrides should be minimal and under a single page level class nest.

Component level name-spacing:

* nav
* nav-bar
* header-global
* header-about
* section-hero
* section-welcome
* module-wysiwyg
* module-accordion

####Comments
Use comments to separate logical groups of styles within a document. This also allows us to convert from .scss <-> .sass without any hikcups. To get uniforminity with comments, please use the following three.

* The top level of your sass file should contain the name in all uppercase
* Inside your sass file, divide sections up with a comment header
* And for single properties, use //

```
//=================================
// GLOBAL STYLES
//=================================

//---------------------------------
// Section Comment Header
//---------------------------------

// Property comments
```
